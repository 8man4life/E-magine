### Opcodes
| Opcode | Side          | Description |
|:------:| ------------- | ----------- |
| 0      | Client        | Hello opcode, sent from server when first connected. |
| 1      | Server        | Identify opcode, sent by client to authenticate using token. |
| 2      | Client        | Message opcode, sent from server when new messages appear. |
| 10     | Client/Server | Heartbeat opcode to request heartbeat from other side. |
| 11     | Client/Server | Heartbeat ACK opcode, used to acknowledge heartbeat by other side. |

#### Opcode 0 Hello
Server -> Client

This data will be sent when client establishes connection with server gateway.

```json
{
  "op": 0,
  "heartbeat_interval": 45000
}
```

It will also include a `heartbeat_interval` parameter, 
where clients will be expected to send an opcode 10 Heartbeat to the server after that time in milliseconds.

The client should then proceed to send an Identify Opcode right after connecting, which is described below.

#### Opcode 1 Identify
Client -> Server

Clients are supposed to send this opcode and data after establishing connection to the gateway,
in order to verify their identity through the use of the API token obtained after login through the login endpoint.

```json
{
  "op": 1,
  "token": "<insert token here>"
}
```

On successful identification with gateway, the gateway server will send an Opcode 2 Ready packet as shown below,
indicating that we are now ready for realtime message communications.

#### Opcode 2 Ready
Server -> Client

Upon successful authentication and identification with the gateway server through an Opcode 1 Identify,
the gateway server will respond and send this opcode when it is ready for communication and message updates of server.

```json
{
  "op": 1,
  "user": "<User ID>"
}
```

The connection is now ready for message events from the gateway server. All message events will be sent to the gateway client
via an Opcode 3 Message event.
