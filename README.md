# E-magine

A simple E-Learning platform with features such as live chat and live streaming made for the [Nanyang Technological University (NTU) SCSE Computing Challenge 2020](https://scse.ntu.edu.sg/NewsnEvents/Pages/SCSEComputingChallenge2020.aspx) from 18-19th January 2020. This app was awarded the *Technopreneurship (Special Mention) Award*.

*App is no longer maintained since the competition ended and may very well be unusable, but we hope it will find some use in the future.* :smile:
